My recipe site assignment
This website is just going to confirm my website builidng skills (brutalist style).
I willl add recipes as separate linked pages, pictures, and possibly add new text styles, we shall see. I want it to look kind of organized but also kind of rogue, this is my first project after all. I will reflect after my final version is uploaded

Thank you
