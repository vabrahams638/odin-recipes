			<h3> <p> Description </p> </h3>
			<b3> <p> Let's get real for a second. Nobody really knows how to make lasagna. This is a recipe that I found on the internet. It is apparently the best, but I will still manage to burn my house down on the first attempt. Please enjoy lovelies :) </p></b3>

			<h3> <p> Ingredients </p> </h3>
			<b4> <p> For the Bechamel Sauce </p> </b4>
				<ul><p>	
					<li> 4 tablespoons butter</li>
					<li> 1/4 cup flour, all purpose or plain</li>
					<li> 3 1/2 cups milk</li>
					<li> 1 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese (If you do not like parmesan, replace it with Gruyere, Romano, Asiago, Manchego, or more Mozzarella)</li>
				</p></ul>
			<b4> <p> For the Meat Sauce </p></b4>
				<ul><p>
					<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
					<li> 1 onion, finely chopped</li>
					<li> 1 carrot, finely diced</li>
					<li> 4 cloves garlic cloves, minced</li>
					<li> 24 ounces (700 grams) ground beef mince</li>
					<li> 10 ounces (300 grams) ground pork mince, or beef</li>
					<li> 24 ounces (700 grams) Passata</li>
					<li> 14 ounces (410 grams) crushed tomatoes</li>
					<li> 3 heaped tablespoons tomato paste, (I use garlic and herbs flavoured)</li>

					<li> 1 teaspoon each dried oregano and basil</li>
					<li> 1/2 teaspoon sugar, (if desired)</li>
					<li> Salt and pepper, season to your tastes</li>
				</p></ul>
			<b4> <p> For the Lasagna </p></b4>
				<ul><p>
					<li>13 ounces (375 grams) fresh lasagna sheets*</li>
					<li> 17 ounces (500 grams) fresh mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
					<li> 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
			
				</p></ul>
			<b4> <p> <em> these homies decided to talk about fresh pasta after that whole asterisk after fresh lasagna sheets to remind us that store bought is fine like we were gonna be professiona and make individual pasta sheets but here it is: </p> </em> <p> *Fresh lasagna pasta sheets are found in the refrigerator section of most grocery stores. We prefer fresh pasta in our lasagna, but if you can't find or don't have access to fresh, you can use dried. </p> </b4>

				<h3> <p> Make the Meat Sauce: </p> </h3>
				<li> Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until softened. Add in the garlic and saute for about 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
				<li> Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with the end of your spoon, until browned.</li>
				<li> Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with desired amount of salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 teaspoon each) and sugar if needed. </li>
				<li> Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes, occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is tender.</li>
				<li> Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<h3> <p> Make the Bechamel Sauce: </p> </h3>
				<li> In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from hot plate; add the flour and whisk for about 30 seconds, or until well blended.</li>
				<li> Place pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low and slowly whisk in 1 cup of the milk until well combined. Once well blended, add the remaining milk in 1 cup increments, mixing well after each addition, until all the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns into a nice and creamy consistency.</li>
				<li> Increase heat to medium and continue cooking sauce while stirring occasionally until it thickens (about 6-7 minutes) and coats the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
				<li> Add in the parmesan cheese and remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper and mix until the cheese is melted through.</li>
			</ol>
